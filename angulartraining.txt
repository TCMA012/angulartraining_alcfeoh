Data Transfer Object (DTO)

json2ts.com
a website where you can copy-paste any chunk of JSON syntax and get a fully-typed output of interfaces with inferred types and everything.
Quicktype also supports languages other than TypeScript, so you could use that same tool to generate the server-side types for your data in Java
